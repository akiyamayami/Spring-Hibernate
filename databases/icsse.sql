In this world, a new type of internet should connect any objects, any devices, any cyber-physical systems, any firms, companies, anyone &hellip;i.e. anything! This is the basic idea of the term: Internet of Anything (IoA).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet of Anything is the interconnection of any things (devices, systems), anyone, anywhere and anytime within the existing Internet infrastructure.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation will start with a short discussion on the evolution of Internet. The next part will provide a structured, systematic overview of the numerous concepts and technologies linked to modern Internet technology; Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of People (IoP), Internet of Brains (IoB), Internet of Robots (IoR), Internet of Health IoH), Internet of Everything (IoE).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet of Clouds (IoC) or shortly Intercloud as the high-level combination of Internet of Anything and Cloud Technology is also discussed. Intercloud represents the next logical phase in computing enabling complex applications, optimized performance and enhanced reliability. A roadmap for the near future, describing development trends and emerging application areas will be also presented.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key feature of Internet of Anything is the connection of the physical and the virtual world by using 3D Internet. The last part of the presentation summarizes the results and ideas of a newly developed software engine, called MAXWHERE that provides effective working environments with spatial (Virtual Reality) multimedia arrangement and Intelligent System of Systems connectivity.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fundamental idea behind MAXWHERE is the generalization of the Document Object Model (DOM) introducing the Where Object Model (WOM) concept that covers the conventional WEB contents as well as the VR/AR building blocks in a coherent way.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical applications of MAXWHERE includes industrial monitoring and facility support, context-based collaborative working environment, industrial training, and Interactive live presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>About the Speaker:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/Resources/Images/SubDomain/icsse2017/RUDAS_03.JPG\" />&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Imre J.

Located around 50 kilometres north of Ho Chi Minh City, it is essentially a preserved network of tunnels where you will be able to get a good understanding of what life was like for the Viet Cong during the war. This is one section of the larger Cu Chi Tunnels network. It takes around an hour to drive from the city centre. Most people visit Ben Dinh Tunnels as part of a tour, and spend two to three hours learning about the life of the North Vietnamese and exploring a specially designed (and widened) section of the tunnels for yourself. Accompanied by a guide, you will walk through the forest and be given extensive details about the place, which makes it easy for you to paint a picture of back in the days.

Here, you&rsquo;ll find eating stalls inside the market where you can get a taste of hawker-style Vietnamese cuisine or simply cool off with a cold drink when the bargaining becomes too much. The market is big, difficult to navigate at times and certainly best avoided during the hottest part of the day but all the same its well worth a look. When night falls, restaurants around the perimeter of the market open their doors creating a vibrant street side scene filling the air with the scents of wok-fried noodles, barbecued fish and meats. One of Saigon&rsquo;s oldest landmarks, Ben Thanh offers a great atmosphere that is absolutely authentically Vietnamese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market/allParagraphs/01/image/ben-thanh-market-side.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSave your appetite and head to Ben Thanh Market in the evening where you can be served some real street style local food at one of the 20 or so eateries that surround the market building. Chefs will cook in front of you with an endless array of cuisine choices including vegetarian noodles, fresh seafood, crispy rice pancakes and steamed cakes. You will be in great local company as most of the places thrive with locals enjoying a bite to eat and a quick drink on their way home from work. For shopping heaven head to the market preferably early morning to pick up some bargains including lacquer ware, bamboo goods, arts and crafts. Also on sale are clothes, textiles, luggage, watches and an assortment of electronic goods. Spices, nuts and local fruits heavily scent the air which is also filled with the chatter of tourists and locals haggling for bargains. Do note however that some items will be strictly fixed price. Ben Thanh Market is situated in District 1 in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City at the intersection of Le Loi, Ham Ngh, Tan Hung and Le Lai streets. Shops close late afternoon with shopping best done in the morning before the heat of the day hits. The market is one of Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s most famous landmarks and is known by all taxi drivers, although if you are staying downtown check first to see if you can walk to it from your hotel as it&rsquo;s very centrally located.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market/allParagraphs/04/image/ben-thanh-market-inside.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more at: http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market.htm?cid=ch:OTH:001</p>\r\n'),(8,'contact','<p><a href=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/?ArticleId=b4031ebe-e802-4402-a49a-5769943872a5\">CONTACT INFORMATION</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>CONFERENCE&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nEmail: icsse2017@hcmute.edu.vn<br />\r\nLocation: HCMC University of Technology and Education<br />\r\n01 Vo Van Ngan Street, Linh Chieu Ward, Thu Duc District, Ho Chi Minh City&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>VIETNAM</strong><br />\r\n1.
